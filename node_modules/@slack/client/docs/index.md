So you want to build a Slack app with Node.js? We've got you covered. {{ site.product_name }} is aimed at making
building Slack apps ridiculously easy. It helps you build on all aspects of the Slack platform, from dropping
notifications in channels to fully interactive bots.

## Requirements

This package supports Node v6 and higher. It's highly recommended to use
[the latest LTS version of node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written
using syntax and features from that version.

## Installation

Use npm to install the package and save it to your `package.json`:

```shell
$ npm install @slack/client
```

## Features

The Slack platform offers several APIs to build apps. Each API delivers part of the capabilities
from the platform, with a range of complexity and functionality, so that you can pick the one that
fits for your app.

| Slack API    | Outgoing | Incoming | NPM Package         | Documentation     |
|--------------|:--------:|:--------:|---------------------|-------------------|
| Web API      | ⬆️        | ⬜️       | `@slack/client`     | [Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/web_client.md %}) |
| RTM API      | ⬆️        | ⬇️        | `@slack/client`     | [Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rtm_client.md %}) |
| Incoming Webhooks | ⬆️   | ⬜️       | `@slack/client`     | [Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/incoming_webhook.md %}) |
| Events API   | ⬜️       | ⬇️        | `@slack/events-api` | [README](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-events-api) |
| Interactive Messages | ⬜️ | ⬇️      | `@slack/interactive-messages` | [README](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages) |

**Just starting out?** We suggest starting at the
[Getting Started guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/getting_started.md %}) which will walk you
through building your first Slack app using Node.js.

**Not sure about which APIs are right for your app?** Read our
[helpful blog post](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/getting-started-with-slacks-apis-f930c73fc889)
that explains and compares the options. If you're still not sure,
[reach out for help](#getting-help) and our community can guide you.

You'll notice that some of the API tools are not included in the `@slack/client` package.
This reflects the fact that those tools function as HTTP servers, whereas this package contains
the tools which function as HTTP clients. Separating these packages gives you the flexibility to
only depend on the parts that fit into your app.

If you're looking for an all-in-one solution that hides the underlying Slack APIs, but
simplifies building a bot-style app inside Slack, try the
[Hubot Slack adapter](https://slackapi.github.io/hubot-slack/). This framework is popular for
internal apps that automate workflows, perform ChatOps, or just generate silly memes.
