# Maintainers Guide

This document describes tools, tasks and workflow that one needs to be familiar with in order to effectively maintain
this project. If you use this package within your own software as is but don't plan on modifying it, this guide is
**not** for you.

## Tools

All you need to work with this project is a supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
(see `package.json` field "engines") and npm (which is distributed with Node.js).

## Tasks

### Testing

This package has unit tests for most modules (files) in the `test` directory. The structure mirrors the `lib` directory closely. You can run the entire test suite using the npm script `npm test`. This command is also executed by Travis, the continuous integration service, for every Pull Request and branch. The coverage is computed with the `istanbul` package. The tests themselves are run using the `mocha` test runner.

Test code should be written in syntax that runs on the oldest supported Node.js version, without transpiling. This ensures that backwards compatibility is tested and the APIs look reasonable in versions of Node.js that do not support the most modern syntax.

A useful trick for debugging inside tests is to use the Chrome Debugging Protocol feature of Node.js to set breakpoints and interactively debug. In order to do this you must run mocha directly. This means that you should have already linted the source (`npm run lint`), manually. You then run the tests using the following command: `./node_modules/.bin/mocha test/{test-name}.js --debug-brk --inspect` (replace {test-name} with an actual test file).

### Generating Documentation

The documentation is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with GitHub Pages.
The source files are contained in the `docs` directory.

Part of the documentation is the reference docs, which are generated from comments in the source files using the
[JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) markup syntax. The comments are first processed by running `npm run docs:jsdoc`, which
enriches the comments using type information from TypeScript and places them into an independent file in the
`support/jsdoc` directory. Next, these comments are turned into markdown for the Jekyll site using the `npm run docs`
script. These two commands should be run each time an API changes to keep the documentation site updated.

### Releasing

0.  Update generated content
    *  Reference docs are updated using `npm run docs:jsdoc`, `npm run docs`

1.  Create the commit for the release:
    *  Bump the version number in adherence to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) in `package.json`.
    *  Add a changelog entry. Release notes should mention contributors (@-mentions) and issues/PRs (#-mentions). An entry is a new file in `docs/_posts`.
    *  Commit with a message including the new version number. For example `v1.0.8`.
    *  Tag the commit with the version number. For example `v1.0.8`.

2.  Merge into master repository
    *  Create a pull request with the commit that was just made. Be certain to include the tag. For
       example: `git push username master:rel-v1.0.8 && git push --tags username`.
    *  Once tests pass and a reviewer has approved, merge the pull request. You will also want to
       update your local `master` branch.

3.  Distribute the release
    *  Publish to the package manager. Once you have permission to publish on npm, you can run `npm publish`.
    *  Create a GitHub Release. Reuse the release notes written for the changelog entry.

4.  (Slack Internal) Communicate the release internally. Include a link to the GitHub Release.

5.  Announce on Slack Team dev4slack in #slack-api

6.  (Slack Internal) Tweet? Not necessary for patch updates, might be needed for minor updates,
    definitely needed for major updates. Include a link to the GitHub Release.

## Workflow

### Versioning and Tags

This project is versioned using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), particularly in the
[npm flavor](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning). Each release is tagged
using git.

### Branches

`master` is where active development occurs. Long running named feature branches are occasionally
created for collaboration on a feature that has a large scope (because everyone cannot push commits
to another person's open Pull Request). At some point in the future after a major version increment,
there may be maintenance branches for older major versions.

### Issue Management

Labels are used to run issues through an organized workflow. Here are the basic definitions:

*  `bug`: A confirmed bug report. A bug is considered confirmed when reproduction steps have been
   documented and the issue has been reproduced.
*  `enhancement`: A feature request for something this package might not already do.
*  `docs`: An issue that is purely about documentation work.
*  `tests`: An issue that is purely about testing work.
*  `needs feedback`: An issue that may have claimed to be a bug but was not reproducible, or was otherwise missing some information.
*  `discussion`: An issue that is purely meant to hold a discussion. Typically the maintainers are looking for feedback in this issues.
*  `question`: An issue that is like a support request because the user's usage was not correct.
*  `semver:major|minor|patch`: Metadata about how resolving this issue would affect the version number.
*  `security`: An issue that has special consideration for security reasons.
*  `good first contribution`: An issue that has a well-defined relatively-small scope, with clear expectations. It helps when the testing approach is also known.
*  `duplicate`: An issue that is functionally the same as another issue. Apply this only if you've linked the other issue by number.

**Triage** is the process of taking new issues that aren't yet "seen" and marking them with a basic
level of information with labels. An issue should have **one** of the following labels applied:
`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `needs feedback`, `docs`, `tests`, or `discussion`.

Issues are closed when a resolution has been reached. If for any reason a closed issue seems
relevant once again, reopening is great and better than creating a duplicate issue.

## Everything else

When in doubt, find the other maintainers and ask.
